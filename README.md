# 🌍 Air Quality Index (AQI) Checker – Arduino + MQ-135  

## 📖 Project Overview  
This project is an **Arduino-based AQI monitoring system** that measures air quality using the **MQ-135 gas sensor**.  
The system displays real-time AQI values on an LCD screen and provides alerts using an LED and buzzer when air pollution levels exceed safe limits.  

It is a simple yet effective way to raise awareness about air quality in homes, schools, and urban environments.

## 📜 How It Works  
1. The **MQ-135 sensor** detects air quality by measuring gas concentration levels.  
2. Arduino reads the analog signal from MQ-135 and converts it into an **AQI value**.  
3. The **LCD** displays the current AQI status (Good, Moderate, Poor, Hazardous).  
4. If pollution levels rise above a threshold, the **buzzer sounds** and the **LED blinks** as an alert.  

---

## 💻 Usage Instructions  
1. Connect the circuit as per the wiring table.  
2. Upload the provided Arduino sketch (`AQI_Checker.ino`) to your Arduino board.  
3. Power the system via USB or battery.  
4. Observe AQI values on the LCD.  
5. If AQI is poor, the system will automatically trigger **LED + Buzzer alerts**.

## 🚀 Future Improvements  
- Integrate **Wi-Fi (ESP8266/ESP32)** to upload AQI data to the cloud.  
- Develop a **mobile app dashboard** for real-time monitoring.  
- Add **data logging (SD card)** for long-term air quality analysis.  
- Expand to measure **temperature, humidity, and dust particles** with additional sensors.
